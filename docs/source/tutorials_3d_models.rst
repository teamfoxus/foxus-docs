Importing 3D Models
===================================

.. note::

   Here be dragons! 
   
   Positioning of 3D models in a mixed reality space is not an exact science.

   Just placing an object in Godot will not anchor it to a "real" position in space.

   Moving your head, or moving within the space, may move 3D objects in unexpected ways. 

   This problem could likely be solved with the use of pose estimation tools like `ArUco markers <https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d5/dae/tutorial_aruco_detection.html>`_.
