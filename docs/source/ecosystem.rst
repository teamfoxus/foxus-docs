Foxus Camera
--------

The Foxus camera is a nifty bit of hardware -- two high-quality stereoscopic cameras that go on the front of your VR device to allow full-color passthrough video.

*They look great, too.*

Right now, these play nice with the Godot engine, using a special plugin called gd_eiffelcam to process the video feeds. You can connect them to a Meta Quest headset using a microUSB to USB-C cable. You can also connect them directly to a computer, where the feeds can be used in other programs with a bit of hackery!

Foxus Playback
--------

The Foxus playback engine is an app that runs on your Quest 2 headset to give you access to mixed reality experiences. It can be installed via Sidequest, or using ADB to install the latest APK.

This App currently allows you to adjust the colour of the video feed with a menu of LUTS, which is the first MR experience we have implemented. You can use our Foxus Creator platform powered by Godot to create your own MR content to be viewed in the Foxus App.

Rather than a fully virtual reality experience, or an augmented reality experience where digital assets are overlaid on reality, we use the term mixed reality because the Foxus is for processing and altering the optical flow feed through these cameras.

We're also working on adding networking features so that your Foxus can sync up with others in the same room, and you can share some communal MR experiences. 

Foxus Creator
--------

The Foxus Creator engine is powered by Godot, and here you'll be able to create MR experiences on your home computer and preview them inside of a headset. Foxus Creator runs on the Godot engine, but we are developing it for people who don't necessarily have experience with Godot. If you're a Godot power user, we're hoping to also provide a plugin to enhance your regular Godot environment.

Foxus Storefront (Coming soon...)
--------

Made something great? Upload it to the Foxus storefront and anyone can use it inside the Foxus playback engine. Charge money or make it free. You decide if your creations are Mixable (can be edited by the purchaser) or set in stone.

Other Foxus Toys (Coming soonâ€¦)
--------

Maybe you don't have a Quest ... there are alternatives coming soon!

   Here be dragons! The dragons here are especially large. 
   
   The Foxus Toy is under super secret development.
