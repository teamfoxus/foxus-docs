Particle Systems
===================================

Godot has a system for creating particle effects, which we can easily use in Foxus to great effect. 

After you open the project, check the left side of the screen to see the Scene hierarchy. Directly below the tab that reads "Scene" is a + button. You can click this, or hit CTRL-A, to create a new node within your scene. 

You'll be given heaps of options in the new window that appears, but just type in "Particles" and it will give you fewer to choose from.

CPUParticles and the regular Particles type will have different performance on different devices. For now, let's go with the regular one. You can hit the "Create" button to add it to your scene.
