`Foxus <http://www.foxus.com>`_ is a project experimenting with passthrough Augmented Reality on existing devices. It uses a stereoscopic camera add-on that runs on the Oculus Quest 2 at 60fps, with full RGB passthrough. The Foxus is built with community support by the team at `voxels.com <http://www.voxels.com>`_.
